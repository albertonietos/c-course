 * ------------
 * The function prints the binary representation of the parameter unsigned char

/* DESCRIPTION:
 * ------------
 * The function extracts a sequence of bits from the binary data. The length of 
 * the sequence is defined in by the parameter how_many and the sequence starts
 * from index i (inclusive).
 *
 * If the parameter how_many is less than 8, the byte will be padded with zeroes
 * on the left side. For example if you extract 2 bits (11), the return value
 * is 00000011, which is equal to 3.
 *
 * The maximum length of extracted sequence for this function is 8, you do not
 * need to handle any invalid parameters.
 *
 * NOTE: The const unsigned char* data is likely to hold more than one byte of
 *       information. The extracted sequence also can continue over byte
 *       boundaries i.e. the extracted bit data can exist within two different
 *       bytes.
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 * ------------
 * const unsigned char* data: an array of binary data, where the sequence is 
 * extracted from.
 *
 * int i: the starting index of the extracted sequence.
 * int how_many: the length of the extracted sequence.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 * ------------
 * The extracted sequence stored in a single unsigned char.
